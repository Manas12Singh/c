In the realm of transportation, electric vehicles (EVs) have gained significant traction in recent years. With zero tailpipe emissions, EVs offer a greener alternative to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

The field of biotechnology continues to push boundaries in various domains, from healthcare to agriculture. Genetic engineering techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 have revolutionized gene editing, enabling precise modifications in DNA sequences.

Augmented reality (AR) has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing user experiences in diverse industries. By overlaying digital information in the real world, AR enables immersive and interactive interactions.
